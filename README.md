# HilbertTransformPrecisionAnalysis
Explore Hilbert transform precision with this Python repository. Analyze sensitivity to power and delay inaccuracies in both nonuniformly and uniformly spaced delay-line filters. Includes optimized implementations and visualizations.
**README:**



This repository explores the impact of inaccuracies in power and delay on the precision of the Hilbert transform. The analysis is based on the findings presented in [APPENDIX II: Inaccuracies in Power and Delay in Hilbert Transform Precision].

## Contents

- `nonuni_HT_analysis.py`: Python script for analyzing the precision of the Hilbert transform using a nonuniformly spaced delay-line filter.

- `uni_HT_analysis.py`: Python script for analyzing the precision of the Hilbert transform using a uniformly spaced delay-line filter.

- `response_nonuni_HT.py`: Optimized Python implementation of the Hilbert transform response with a nonuniformly spaced delay-line filter.

- `response_uni_HT.py`: Optimized Python implementation of the Hilbert transform response with a uniformly spaced delay-line filter.

- `error_analysis_plots.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing visualizations of the impact of error rates on tap coefficients.
