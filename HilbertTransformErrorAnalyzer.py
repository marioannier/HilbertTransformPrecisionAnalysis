      HilbertTransformErrorAnalyzer - Class for analyzing errors in the fractional Hilbert transform.

      This class is designed to determine the error in the fractional Hilbert transform when using
      nonuniformly delayed taps coefficients approach with empirical probabilities.

      Attributes:
          coefficients (list): List of coefficients for the nonuniformly delayed taps approach.
          empirical_probabilities (list): List of empirical probabilities used in the analysis.

      Methods:
          __init__(self, coefficients, empirical_probabilities):
              Initializes the HilbertTransformErrorAnalyzer with coefficients and empirical probabilities.

          calculate_error(self):
              Calculates the error in the fractional Hilbert transform based on the provided coefficients
              and empirical probabilities.

      Example usage:
          >>> coefficients = [0.5, 0.2, -0.1, 0.3]
          >>> probabilities = [0.25, 0.4, 0.2, 0.15]
          >>> analyzer = HilbertTransformErrorAnalyzer(coefficients, probabilities)
          >>> error = analyzer.calculate_error()
          >>> print(error)

    def response_nonuni_HT(f, ak, tk, T):
        """
        Calculate the response of a fractional Hilbert transformer based on a nonuniformly spaced delay-line filter.

        The fractional Hilbert transformer response H_FHT(ω) can be expressed as:
